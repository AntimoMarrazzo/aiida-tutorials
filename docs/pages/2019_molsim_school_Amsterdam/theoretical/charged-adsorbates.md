Next challenge: are you able to find the best material for carbon capture?

The sequestration of carbon dioxide from flue gasses is an active field of research,
where actually MOFs appear to be very promising.

The 502 structures you are using have charges, so remember to switch on in Raspa
the calculation of Coulombic interactions, using the Ewald method.

You can use the CO2 molecule model from the TraPPE force field, and a typical
reference for indicating the material performance for carbon capture is the
CO2 uptake that you can achieve at 298K and 0.2bar.

What do you think are the characteristics of the materials showing high affinity with carbon dioxide?
