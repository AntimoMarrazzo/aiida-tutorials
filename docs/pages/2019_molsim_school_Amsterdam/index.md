# Metal-organic frameworks for methane storage applications

This tutorial is part of the 
[Understanding molecular simulation](http://www.acmm.nl/molsim/molsim2019/)
school held at the University of Amsterdam from January 7-18 2019.

It is meant to be run inside the [Quantum Mobile](https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile) virtual machine,
using a compute resource with [zeo++](http://www.zeoplusplus.org/) and [RASPA2](https://github.com/numat/RASPA2) installed.

**Note:** This tutorial requires a basic knowledge of python. If you are
not familiar with python, partner with someone who is.
